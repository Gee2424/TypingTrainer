# Aim Trainer and Typing Trainer

This repository contains two Python scripts: `AimTrainer.py` and `TypingTrainer.py`. These scripts provide interactive games to improve your aiming skills and typing speed, respectively. Let's take a closer look at each script:

## Aim Trainer (`AimTrainer.py`)

The Aim Trainer game is designed to help you enhance your accuracy and reflexes. It simulates a target-shooting scenario where you need to click on targets that appear on the screen. The game tracks your hits, misses, and average response time.

### How to Play

1. Run the `AimTrainer.py` script using Python.
2. A window titled "Aim Trainer" will open.
3. Targets will randomly appear on the screen.
4. Use your mouse to aim and click on the targets.
5. If you hit a target, it will disappear, and your hit count will increase.
6. If you miss a target, your miss count will increase.
7. The game calculates and displays your average response time.
8. Close the window to exit the game.

## Typing Trainer (`TypingTrainer.py`)

The Typing Trainer game helps you improve your typing speed and accuracy. It displays falling characters, and you need to type them before they reach the bottom of the screen. The game keeps track of your score, misses, and typing speed.

### How to Play

1. Run the `TypingTrainer.py` script using Python.
2. A window titled "Typing Trainer" will open.
3. Characters will start falling from the top of the screen.
4. Type the characters before they reach the bottom of the screen.
5. If you type a character correctly, it will disappear, and your score will increase.
6. If you mistype a character or let it reach the bottom, your miss count will increase.
7. The game calculates and displays your typing speed in characters per minute (CPM).
8. Close the window to exit the game.

## Requirements

Both games require the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

To install the Pygame library, run the following command:

```shell
pip install pygame

## Running the Games

To play either of the games, execute the corresponding script using Python:

```shell
python AimTrainer.py

```shell
python TypingTrainer.py
